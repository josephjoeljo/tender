# Behaviors worth remembering

Things about how Tender works that may not be what you'd assume.

## Services

- **Working directory:** services default to `/`, not the directory you ran
  `tender start` from. Set one with `--cwd`. A path under `~/Documents` will probably
  fail: launchd jobs were denied access there (`getcwd: Operation not permitted`).
- **Root:** a service can't run as root. `--user root` is rejected.
- **Starting without a command:** `tender start api` starts an existing service. If
  there's no service but a binary was dropped in `bin/api/`, it creates the service
  from the newest release.
- **Restart count:** it comes from launchd's run count, so manual restarts count too,
  and it resets to 0 after `tender stop` or anything else that reloads the job.
- **Unknown names:** `stop` and `restart` return an error, since it's probably a typo.
  `delete` succeeds, since the service is already gone.

## Releases

- **Rollback:** it holds even with a newer binary still in `bin/`. Only a change to that
  file deploys again.

## Logs

- **Rotation gap:** rotation is copy-truncate, so lines written between the copy and the
  truncate are lost.

## Adopted jobs

- **Stop doesn't survive login:** `tender stop` on an adopted job in
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents` lasts only until the next login. launchd reloads its plist,
  and Tender never edits it.
- **Delete is refused:** use `tender adopt --forget <label>`, which stops managing the
  job and leaves it as it is.
- **Logs:** Tender reads an adopted job's logs but never rotates them.

## Orphans

- Jobs with Tender's service prefix that aren't in the desired state are only reported
  by `tender list`. Only `tender gc` boots them out.

## Security

- **Secrets:** `state.db` and service plists are `0600`, because they can hold secrets
  from `--env`.
- **Production CLI:** the socket is root-only, so `tender` needs sudo against a
  production daemon. The manual production check is in
  [production-install.md](production-install.md).
